        Review the JavaScript/TypeScript code and verify that it complies with the following naming conventions:

        Variables:
        - Prefix boolean variables with "is", "has", "can", "should", or "will" to clearly indicate they return true/false values
        - Example: isActive, areUsersVisible, hasPermission, mustCreate

        Constants:
        - Global constants should be declared using 'const SNAKE_UPPERCASE = value;' syntax at the top of the file. Replace all magic values with direct references to these constants - do not create intermediate variables. 
        - Generic constants: use an ENUM
        - No useless assignment

        Use Case:
        - All constructor parameters must be gateway interfaces, service interfaces, repository interfaces or configuration objects

        Service Interface Naming:
        - Use singular form
        - File name should end with "Service"
        - Must be in a contextual folder in src/hexagone/services
        - Example: UserService.ts

        Service Implementation Naming:
        - Use singular form
        - File name should end with "Service"
        - Must be in the same folder as the service interface
        - Must implement the Service Interface
        - Must be prefixed with "Internal"
        - Example: InternalUserService.ts

        Service Stub Naming:
        - Use singular form
        - File name should end with "Stub"
        - Must be in the same folder as the service interface
        - Must implement the Service Interface

        - Example: UserServiceStub.ts

        Gateway Interface Naming:
        - Use singular form
        - File name should end with word like "Provider" or "Manager", "Builder", etc.
        - Must be in src/hexagone/gateways
        - Example: DateProvider.ts

        Gateway Implementation Naming:

        - Use singular form
        - File name should end with "Stub"
        - Must be in src/adapters/secondary/gateways
        - Must implement the Gateway Interface
        - Must not be prefixed
        - Example: DateProviderStub.ts

        Repository Interface Naming:
        - Use singular form
        - File name should end with "Repository"
        - Must be in src/hexagone/repositories
        - Example: UserRepository.ts

        Repository Implementation Naming:
        - Use singular form
        - File name should end with "Repository"
        - Must be in src/adapters/secondary/repositories

        - Must not be prefixed
        - Example: UserRepositoryStub.ts

        Stub Implementation:
        - Each stub method must return the value of a property named after the method + "Data"
        - Each stub method must store its parameters in a property named after the method + "Params" in an array of objects containing each parameter

        - One class per file

        Operator Style:
        - Operators (+, -, *, /, &&, ||, etc.) should be placed at the beginning of the line

        Code Structure:
        - Use early returns to reduce nesting and improve readability

        Type Safety:
        - Never use the 'any' type
        - Use proper TypeScript types or 'unknown' if type is truly unknown

        Magic Values:
        - No magic values/numbers in the code
        - All constant values must be defined as named constants

        Debugging:
        - No console.log, console.error, console.warn, or console.debug statements in production code
        - Use proper logging service instead
        - Remove all debugging statements before committing

        Directory Naming:
        - All directory names must be lowercase
        - Use kebab-case for multi-word directory names

        Date Handling:
        - Never use new Date() without parameters
        - Never create a date based on the current system time
        - Always explicitly specify date parameters
        - For current date needs, use a dedicated service (e.g., DateProvider)

        External Libraries:
        - External libraries can only be used in adapters (src/adapters)
        - Hexagon (src/hexagone) must remain framework and library agnostic
        - All external dependencies must be abstracted through interfaces in /src/hexagone
        - Use dependency injection to provide external library implementations

        Error Handling:
        - Never throw outside /src/hexagone
        - Errors other than native "Error" must end with "Exception"
        - Native Errors can be throwed
        - Error messages must be in French

        Testing:
        - All tests must be in the same folder as the code they are testing
        - All unit tests must be in /src/hexagone/tests/unit and must be named like "<class-name>.spec.ts"
        - All integration tests must be in /src/adapters/secondary and must be named like "<class-name>.it.spec.ts"
        - All e2e tests must be in /src/adapters/primary and must be named like "<class-name>.e2e.spec.ts"
        - All use cases must be tested with unit tests using Stub
        - All services must be tested with unit tests
        - All gateways must be tested with integration tests
        - All repositories must be tested with integration tests
        - All controllers must be tested with e2e tests
        - All tests must start with "Doit" or "Ne doit pas"
        - Use "test" instead of "it" for tests
        - Don't use toBeTruthy or toBeFalsy
        - Use toEqual instead of toBe when comparing values
        - Unit tests must be using Stub Repositories, Stub Gateways and Stub Services instead of the real ones or mocks
        - Unit tests must cover all code paths
        - Integration tests must cover all code paths

        Comments:
        - All interface properties must be commented
        - All interface method parameters must be commented

        Frontend Naming:
        - Use "handle" prefix for event listeners
        - Use "render" prefix for functions that return content

        Frontend Components:
        - Components must have .tsx extension
        - One component per file
        - Develop new components as functional components (not class components)
        - Declare functions that don't use React elements outside the component
        - Don't use indexes in keys
        - Handle spam clicks on buttons with disabled attribute and optionally a loader
        - Handle loading and error cases for API calls
        - JSX conditional rendering must use boolean values (use !!variable to convert to boolean when necessary) to avoid displaying text in render

        Frontend Styling:
        - Use CSS Module SASS with one SCSS file per component: ComponentName.module.scss
        - No inline CSS
        - Add identifiers to unique elements for targeting
        - Use SCSS variables for colors and font-weight
        - Use !important only when absolutely necessary (impossible to target element more precisely)
        - Style file must be imported last in the component

        CSS Naming Conventions:
        - Use ID for unique elements, class for multiple elements
        - Use kebab-case for all CSS selectors
        - Use descriptive names that indicate the element's purpose
        - Use consistent prefixes: # for IDs, . for classes
        - Use semantic naming that reflects the element's function or content
        - Group related elements with consistent naming patterns
        - Use lowercase letters only
        - Separate words with hyphens
        - Be specific but concise in naming
        - For containers: #<entity>-<type> (example: #users-list, #products-grid)
        - For items within containers: .<id>-<type> (example: .user-123-item, .product-456-card)
        - For actions: #<action>-<entity>-<type> (example: #create-user-button, #delete-product-link)
        - For filters: #<name>-<entity>-<type> (example: #search-users-input, #filter-products-select)
        - For components: #<name>-<component-type> (example: #user-profile-modal, #product-details-drawer)

        Table Page:
        - Macro filters: #<name>-macrofilter (example: #brouillon-macrofilter)
        - Filters: #<name>-<entities>-<field-type> (example: #statut-factures-select or #search-factures-input)
        - Table: #<entities>-table (example: #factures-table)
        - Table rows: .<id>-row (example: .671a637c5732b54f9a3ef2e5-row)
        - Table cells: .<column-name>-cell (example: .statut-cell)
        - Buttons in table cells: .<action>-button (example: .remove-button)
        - Action buttons outside table: #<action>-<entity(ies)>-button (example: #download-factures-button or #create-facture-button)

        List:
        - List: #<entities>-list (example: #factures-list)
        - List items: .<id>-item (example: .671a637c5732b54f9a3ef2e5-item)

        Tag:
        - .<value>-tag (example: .lost-tag)

        Modal, Drawer, Popover:
        - #<name>-<field-type> (example: #validation-confirmation-modale or #creation-facture-drawer)
